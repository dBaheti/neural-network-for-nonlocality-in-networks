## Intro
In the paper above, we describe a generative neural network to tackle the classical causal inference problem encountered in quantum network nonlocality. The neural network basically tries to learn classical/local models for a given distribution and causal structure.

## Usage
In sample_code, set your parameters in config.py. Then run train.py.

In case you'd like to modify the causal structure under examination check out utils.py

## Code structure
In sample_code you will find sample code for running the algorithm (including adding noise), for several possible distributions, such as the elegant distribution, Fritz distribution, or Renou et al. distribution.

For a first test, **just run train.py** to see training for the Fritz distribution and its noisy versions (visibility added to the singlet).

* `config.py`: contains the Config class. A joint, global config file (named pnn, for Parameter of Neural Network) is used among all files. This contains (almost) all meta-data related to the neural network, target distribution, and training. Note that the causal structure is defined in utils.py
* `utils.py`: contains utilities. Most notably the build_model() function is located here, which defines the causal structure.
* `targets.py`: Auxiliary file used by me to generate target distributions. If you want your own target distributions either add them to the list in this file, or just load them directly into Config class and disregard the targets.py file.
* `train.py`: **Run this python script to train the network for a set of target distributions.** Target distributions and neural network parameters should be defined in config.py.
